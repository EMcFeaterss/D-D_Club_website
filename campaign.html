	    <p>A group of misfit merchants are having a day as normal as any other. That was until a man came up to their wagon, requesting to purchase a dagger for much more than its listed price. One of the merchants decides that this man can have the dagger, in his chest that is. This attempted attack fails horribly, resulting in the imprisonment of the group. They also find out that their carriage contained stolen goods. After the merchant who attempted to stab the man acts like an idiot, guards come in to chain him to the wall. A ball gag was also placed into his mouth to prevent more trouble. After their friend was unbound, an odd looking man with a briefcase entered the room and greetted the merchants. This man gave the party a key to escape, and the party did just that. After minor complications, the party ended up on a pirate ship that was in space. The party had to fight off a space worm, greet another entire ship of people who joined them, and eventually go to a large city in the sky. A large guard-looking man claimed that their boat was stolen. One member, the rogue who was also the one who has a ballgag, of the party went to investigate a ticking sound in the bottom of the ship, and found the captain (not of their ship) and the time godess, who I failed to mention earlier, who was being held captive in an escape pod. There was also a time bomb and the member who was down there was captured as well, moving him away from the explosion that occured. This explosion absolutely destroyed the ship, but luckily no one was damaged. The party (that wasn't kidnapped) eventually chased after the escape pod and got into a fight with it, ending in their captain forcing the party to take the escape pods that were left as he sank with his ship. The party then met a man after they had landed who fed them and then sent them on a quest for a rare metal. The captured party member was still in the escape pod with the other captain. After finding the rare metal, the party found the remains of a ship, presumably the one that had fallen down, and there was the captain who was thought to be dead along with two random children. The party harassed the captain until he told them to leave, and after looting the other half of the ship that was close by, one of the party members casted fireball in the half of the ship with the captain and kids. The captain was actually a doppleganger, a weird, lenghy, and pale creature, that was pretending to be the captain. The captured party member got let free with the task to find a wanted man named Jackson. The party reunites and they find Jackson, the cactus loving cowboy. Everyone arrives to a town that has a wild west feel to it, where the party went to various shops.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
